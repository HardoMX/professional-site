# Integrity

## Cookies?
Cookies can be amazingly useful on the web, but they can also be used to track you across the internet.
**That's why I avoid them on my sites.** In fact, I only have one cookie, which is used to store your preference of light or dark mode.

## What is a cookie?
A cookie is a small piece of text that gets stored locally on your computer. This can be used for things like automatic login, a shopping cart, or tracking you.
Companies like Google and Meta (formerly Facebook) offer statistics and advertisements with the help of their cookies.

These cookies which are from someone other than the owner of the site is called third-party cookies, and just like in real life, they are worse than the homemade kind.
Third-party cookies allow companies like Google and Meta to track you throughout the web by seeing your unique cookie on the sites that use their statistics and advertisement services.

Nowadays there are many other ways to track you, but cookies are still a part of it.
